## 🌐 API Used

This app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch real-time weather data and forecast information.

### Weather data includes:

- Current temperature
- Max and min temperatures
- Weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Forecast for upcoming days

## 🔍 How It Works

1. On app launch, weather data is fetched for a default city (e.g., Cairo).
2. The app displays additional weather data for a few preselected cities.
3. The user can search for any city using the search bar.
4. Weather results are updated instantly.
